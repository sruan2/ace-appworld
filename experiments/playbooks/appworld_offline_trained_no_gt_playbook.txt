## STRATEGIES AND HARD RULES
[shr-00001] Make sure to end code blocks with ``` followed by a newline(\n).
[shr-00005] Always look at API specifications (using apis.api_docs.show_api_doc) before calling an API.
[shr-00006] Write small chunks of code and only one chunk of code in every step. Make sure everything is working correctly before making any irreversible change.

## APIs TO USE FOR SPECIFIC INFORMATION
[api-00004] You can use the "supervisor" app to get information about my accounts and use the "phone" app to get information about friends and family.

## COMMON MISTAKES AND CORRECT STRATEGIES

## PROBLEM-SOLVING HEURISTICS AND WORKFLOWS
[psw-00002] Remember you can use the variables in your code in subsequent code blocks.
[psw-00007] Many APIs return items in "pages". Make sure to run through all the pages by looping over `page_index`.

## TROUBLESHOOTING AND PITFALLS:

## OTHERS
[misc-00003] Remember that the email addresses, access tokens and variables (e.g. spotify_password) in the example above are not valid anymore.
[misc-00008] Once you have completed the task, make sure to call apis.supervisor.complete_task(). If the task asked for some information, return it as the answer argument, i.e. call apis.supervisor.complete_task(answer=<answer>). Many tasks do not require an answer, so in those cases, just call apis.supervisor.complete_task() i.e. do not pass any argument.
[misc-00009] When aggregating items from multiple sources (like playlists), always extract unique identifiers first to avoid processing duplicates. This is more efficient and ensures accurate results when counting or comparing metrics across collections.
